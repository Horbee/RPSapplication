# README

This is a Ruby on Rails web applicaiton, made as a bonus application for the CF 3.11 task.

Visit the deployed site at: https://rpsrailsapp.herokuapp.com/

The application is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The logic of the game is written in javascript (you can find it in the app/assets/javascript/application.js file).
The app uses a Postgress database to save the highscores. If you played a few matches, you can save your name and scores in the database. 
By clicking the Best Highscore button you can see the top 10 best players. The list is ordered by the ratings.

Thank you for playing! :)
